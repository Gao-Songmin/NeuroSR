# NeuroSR
Neuonal images aquired from brain microscopy often suffer from sever anisotropy, characterized by poor axial resolution and unpleasant artifacts, hindering precise morphological analysis. We proposed NeuroSR, a framework for super-resolution of anisotropic neuronal images, aiming to support research on neuronal imaging and analysis.

The code is currently being cleaned up and will be released soon.
